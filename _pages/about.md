I'm a third year undergraduate student from [Institute of High Energy Physics](https://www.ihep.ac.cn/), [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.ucas.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Tong Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~0060921) of CSNS from [Institute of High Energy Physics](https://www.ihep.ac.cn/), University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. I was advised by [Dr. Zhenkun Li](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/mece/9722.html) from [School of Mechanical,Electronic and Control Engineering](https://mece.bjtu.edu.cn//cms/), Beijing Jiaotong University.
